# Compiler, Language and Runtime Teams

A listing of compiler, language and runtime teams for people looking for jobs in this area. My motivation for curating this is in [this blog post](https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2019/12/10/compiler-jobs).

In Scope: Teams that work on language implementations, compilers for languages, language runtimes, static analysis, etc.

### Contributing

[**Please contribute:**](https://github.com/mgaudet/CompilerJobs/pulls) Pass on projects, teams, companies I've missed. 

**Feel free to spruce up the description of the work for teams you know about! Many of these are simply stubs**

### Annotations: 

* 📤: Remote Work Supported

    At the time the icon was added, the company offered remote work. 

* 🧑‍🎓: Internships offered

    These companies are known to have offered internships or co-ops in compiler, languages and runtimes. 

* 🗺 : Location

    Derived from job postings or other knowledge, this is where the team works. Definitely not comprehensive! **Please, help me update this too!**
