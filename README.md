# Compiler, Language and Runtime Teams

A listing of compiler, language and runtime teams for people looking for jobs in this area. Some of my own motivation for this in [this blog post](https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2019/12/10/compiler-jobs)

In Scope: Teams that work on language implementations, compilers for languages, language runtimes, static analysis, etc.
