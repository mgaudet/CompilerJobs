# Compiler, Language and Runtime Teams

A listing of compiler, language and runtime teams for people looking for jobs in this area. My motivation for curating this is in [this blog post](https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2019/12/10/compiler-jobs).

### Scope

- Teams that work on language implementations, compilers for languages, language runtimes, static analysis, etc. This includes things like:
  - Database query compilers
  - HDL & Synthesis Compilers
    
  I want to err on the side of openness! The field is broad, and I don't want to be too close-minded here.
- I generally want evidence that a company has hired at some point in the past or will in the future (which excludes some boutique firms & early stage startups).


### Contributing

[**Please contribute:**](https://github.com/mgaudet/CompilerJobs/pulls) Pass on projects, teams, companies I've missed. 

**Feel free to spruce up the description of the work for teams you know about! Many of these are simply stubs**

I generally link to a company's Careers/Job's page rather than linking to specific jobs -- these links have a longer lifespan than just the straight up link to a job. 

### Annotations: 

* 📤: Remote Work Supported

    At the time the icon was added, the company offered remote work. 

* 🧑‍🎓: Internships offered

    These companies are known to have offered internships or co-ops in compiler, languages and runtimes. 

* 🗺 : Location

    Derived from job postings or other knowledge, this is where the team works. Definitely not comprehensive! **Please, help me update this too!**
