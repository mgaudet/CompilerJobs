# Compiler, Language and Runtime Teams

A listing of compiler, language and runtime teams for people looking for jobs in this area. My motivation for curating this is in [this blog post](https://www.mgaudet.ca/technical/2019/12/10/compiler-jobs).

In Scope: Teams that work on language implementations, compilers for languages, language runtimes, static analysis, etc.

[**Please contribute:**](https://github.com/mgaudet/CompilerJobs/pulls) _Pass on projects, teams, companies I've missed!_ 

#### Annotations: 

##### 📤: Remote Work Supported

As far as things are known, these companies offer remote work opportunities. 

##### 🧑‍🎓: Internships offered

These companies are known to have offered internships or co-ops in compiler, languages and runtimes. 

##### 🗺 : Location

Derived from job postings or other knowledge, this is where the team works. Definitely not comprehensive!
